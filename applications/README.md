# Instructions

This directory contains more advanced JAX-FEM examples (mostly without documentation). For more elementary and tutorial purpose examples, please visit [tutorial](https://deepmodeling.github.io/jax-fem/learn/overview.html) for more information.

TODO (if there is certain interest):

1. Explicit dynamics with mass lumping
1. RVE mechanics (solve for fluctuation field)
