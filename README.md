# JAX-FEM

JAX-FEM is a differentiable finite element package based on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

## Documentation

For installation and user guide, please visit our [documentation](https://deepmodeling.github.io/jax-fem/) for details.

## Key features

JAX-FEM is Automatic Differentiation (AD) + Finite Element Method (FEM), and we support the following features:

- 2D quadrilateral/triangle elements
- 3D hexahedron/tetrahedron elements
- First and second order elements
- Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin boundary conditions
- Linear and nonlinear analysis including
  - Heat equation
  - Linear elasticity
  - Hyperelasticity
  - Plasticity (macro and crystal plasticity)
- Multi-physics problems
- Integration with PETSc for solver options
- Differentiable programming for solving inverse/design problems __without__ deriving sensitivities by hand, e.g.,
  - Topology optimization
  - Optimal thermal control

<!-- **Updates** (Dec 11, 2023):
- We now support multi-physics problems in the sense that multiple variables can be solved monolithically. For example, consider running  `python -m applications.stokes.example`
- Weak form is now defined through  volume integral and surface integral. We can now treat body force, "mass kernel" and "Laplace kernel" in a unified way through volume integral, and treat "Neumann B.C." and "Robin B.C." in a unified way through surface integral.  -->
